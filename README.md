# Description:
  - This project is to build a back-end for an ecommerce site. It is basically a log for availabilites of stocks. For example, for each product, there is a category that it is defined to, and also have the ability to attach a tag to it. In my example, it is an online bookstore, so the book "The Hunger Games" will be in the Sci-Fi category and can have a tag like "Best Seller". The tags, categories and products can be added, modified and deleted as well. 

# Installation: 
  - Clone the repository and open it in your IDE. Within the terminal, sign into your mysql using: mysql -u root p. Then use "source schema.sql" to use the database. Next, in the root of the file, run "npm i" and "npm run seed" to seed the data. After successfully seeding, start it by running "npm start".

# Usage:
  - After completing installation instructions, if you haven't yet, run the project by typing "npm start" in your IDE terminal. The server will successfully start and then head to insomnia to test it out! For more information of a detailed usage, visit: https://youtu.be/_0XrvMX13pw
